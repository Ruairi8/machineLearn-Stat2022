# Machine Learning And Statistics 
---
## Description
Building a Keras model for time series anomaly detection, this is contained in Project_Notebook file. I also explore 5 topics, including: statistics, models, parameters, machine learning and more on anomaly detection in the 'Evaluation' file.

## How to Run Jupyter
Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment for writing and running code. The Notebook in my repository is linked with the iPython kernel and therefore runs Python code. Code cells allow users to run code by clicking 'shift-enter'or by clicking the â–¶ button in the toolbar. 'ctrl-enter' runs a selected cell and enters command mode. The Kernel is used to manage running of the code, it can be restarted to nullify all cell outputs or interrupted.

Installation documentation for Jupyter can be found, on [ReadTheDocs](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install.html). More advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For a local installation, it can be installed via pip by running:
``` python
pip install notebook
```
Jupyter is launched with in a local installation:
``` python
jupyter notebook
```
Or for running a Jupyter notebook remotely you need some configuration. See [Running a notebook server](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html).
